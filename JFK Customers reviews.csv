UK,Mar-20,"Worst airport I’ve ever arrived into. Huge queues probably due to the slowest staff ever. Despite queues out of the door and we were there for over 2 hours, staff could be seen chatting to each other between customers (not asking for next in line due to talking) and then taking an age to process, the whole time being very unfriendly and downright rude! Worst security checks anywhere."
US,Mar-20,"The security line set up is totally unreasonable. There is one PreCheck line and no separate ""CLEAR"" line. The ""CLEAR"" machine and staff are placed at the front of TSA PreCheck line, allowing CLEAR customers to cut through the PreCheck line. Really? CLEAR has higher priority than PreCheck? If so, TSA should announce it, so people can decide to buy CLEAR instead of PreCheck. I believe the CLEAR machines and staff should be placed at the end of PreCheck line or a separate area away from the PreCheck line, so when they are confirmed CLEAR, they can get in PreCheck line like all the other PreCheck customers. I suspect CLEAR pays TSA or the airport the get their program this unofficial advantage."
UK,Feb-20,Dreadful experience! Nearly 3 hour wait with two people at the desks. Humourless and arrogant staff when we were finally ‘processed’ with no hint of apology for the time we had waited. Felt like herded cattle and treated similarly. A truly awful introduction to the States.
Jordan,Jan-20,Worst ever arrival immigration process globally. 10h30 am arrival and only one immigration officer for the entire terminal with 3 777 planes. 3 hours waiting queue
UK,Jan-20,"Hundreds of people awaiting to get through arrivals security. 3 out of the 12 booths on our side were open, all the rest shut. Still currently stood waiting, it's been over an hour so far."
US,Jan-20,"Shocking. Ridiculously long queues with slow and unhelpful staff. Half the booths were empty meaning wait times of well over 2 hours. Worst airport I’ve ever been in. Staff treated/talked to you like animals. Arrived back in Australia in Jan 2020 a what a completely wonderful experience. I will look at flying through another airport Newark or LaGuardia as I love visiting New York.
"
UK,Jan-20,"Will never ever use this airport again. Rude, ignorant staff treating people like animals, absolutely shocking. If you treat people like this you will get treated back like it. I have never witnessed so many angry pasengers. Security staff were worst of all, barking and shouting at people like they were vermin. It seems the security staff were on a power trip to see how many people they could ridicule and intimidate. If this is the way the US is going god help them.

Australia,Dec-19,"Absolutely despicable. I have never in my life seen an airport be so disorganised, the staff so so rude, and the lines for security were so long!! All over the world they do it so much better, JFK security is manned by power tripping morons! It took us 2 hours to get through check in and security (travelling with 5 of us, 3 children), and we missed our flight by 5 min! When we were going through security the rude arrogant lady opened every single present my children received for Christmas, opening up the toys with a screwdriver. They do this for phones, iPads, Nintendo switch! Why would they do it for a Harry Potter wand and a Star Wars droid, that I wouldn’t be surprised if it even works now, never been used! Why can’t the X-ray scanner see if there is anything inside it like all other luggage! My son was upset seeing her pull apart his droid which seemed to spur her on in her arrogance and self importance! My daughter who wears an arm brace for her recently operated on elbow gets patted down at each airport, not at JFK, they seem to think 3 different people should pat her down, then they stood there and argued about who is more important and who should’ve done it first! The arrogant self important lady who took a screwdriver to my sons toy, was more upset that she didn’t get to do the pat down than anything, taking pleasure in not only treating us and anyone around her with disrespect and contempt, but the staff that she works with as well! It took us 48min alone to just get through security. I respect the process, but it doesn’t need to be this unpleasant! After all of this the morons at security let through my sons medication which was 250ml of liquid and a pair of scissors (but thank goodness his Harry Potter wand was scrutinised for hidden things). I only know they let these things through because after missing our flight boarding (the plane was still there and the ramp just shut) we went to LeGuardia airport to wait with 3 children for 5 hours on standby and their security picked them up! But guess what, they just scanned the Star Wars droid and Harry Potter wand like any other airport in the free world. Shame on you JFK, clearly you need to invest in visiting first world airports in other major cities around the world, clone what they do, and then maybe you may measure up on the world scale! At the moment you fail dismally and are at the very bottom of the pile."
UK,Nov-19,Worst immigration system I’ve ever experienced! 2 hours in a queue that barely moved. As more fights landed the queues got longer and still a maximum of 2 officers checked people through customs. I will never fly through this airport again. Absolute disgraceful way to treat visitors and puts me totally off coming back to New York.
Canada,Nov-19," Probably the worst airport experience in a major city. The queue time is long and the line is inefficiently managed. The airport staff is very unpleasant, not nice or polite to travellers with lots of screaming and directing. Many bags were opened for no real reason just to hold out the line. The staff at food shops are half-asleep and made diners wait just to fix their nails and gloves. Poor experience in general and was definitely not expecting this level of service at a major airport."
UK,Nov-19,"I was early for a flight at 08.05, 12th November 2019. Went up through security and sat by my gate. At 00.30, a civilian security guard asked me to leave Departures as it was more than 4 hours until my flight. This would mean leaving departures. Going to arrivals and re-submitting my luggage and self back through security. This may or may not be correct although the official website does suggest you are at the terminal at least 3 hours before international flights. Anyway the security guard, who was not rude, refused to identify himself by name or personnel number. I pointed out that I would neeed either for a complaint. He stated, 'just tell them security told you that had to'. I spoke to security downstairs, after going back to arrivals. Again professional, however, they said that complaint could not be made as I couldn't identify the guard. Firstly, I pointed out that, that was because he wouldn't identify himself. Secondly, he spoke to me at 00.30 approximately at gate 9, therefore, not an insolvuable problem. I spoke to the security ops and raised my concerns. If I am to admitted 4 hours before flight then that is now only 1 hour 15 away. Where am I supposed to go for that long? Instead arrivals is like, a not entirely clean, zombie movie. A pity most staff really good."
Singapore,Nov-19,"My wife broke her wrist and small finger and her hand was in a cast the day before. Because she was walking unsteadily, we decided it is better that she be in a wheelchair. When we arrive at the security, she was asked to stand up. Trying to comply, she stood rather unsteadily. The immigration officer kept her standing for while. Another officer asked her to go in through another screen but this same officer scolded her and told her to stand there saying words to the effect, ""How many times have I got to tell you to stand there?"" When he finally deigned to let her go through the security screen, she found herself held up at the other side as two officer tried to find out if her plaster cast on her hand was real or not. ""It's real"" they concluded finally! We complained to the supervisor who was seated after that and she promise to take action. Whether she did or not we don't know. This is nothing but bullying and humiliating people who have visited the US to spend money and was unfortunate to have a fall. If this is how the US customs treat people I think there are many other countries we can go to. We have resolved not to go back to the US for a long time to come."
Belgium,Nov-19,"his is really one of the worst airports I have been to. You can compare it with the one of Cuba Havana with the only difference that there is WiFi, which was not working when we arrived. Security queues where really long when we arrived. All staff (except for 1 funny guy) was unfriendly and not helping customers. Temperature control was really awful. It switched from really hot to windy for a few seconds. Air quality was really breath taking and foods and shops were really not up to standard European airport standards. Really strange that one of the biggest cities in the world has an airport like this."
US,Nov-19,"he passport scanners don't work properly, only passport control person was working. 90 minutes was fun. The airport is dirty and poorly ventilated. Will be sure to avoid in the future and it is a poor reflection on our country. The perfect result of what happens when governments employees run airport."
UK,Nov-19,"My children and I were going through security and had made sure to take off shoes and load trays in readiness for the x-ray machine. In the UK, where we are from, all shoes, coats and bags need to be loaded into trays so this is what we did. Suddenly we found ourselves being shouted at aggressively by a female security attendant who was angry that we hadn’t understood her barked orders to remove bags and shoes from trays. My young son was getting flustered as she was so aggressive in her manner (his first long distance trip) and so she sighed loudly, made some derogatory remark and then removed his shoes angrily from a tray and banged them onto the conveyor belt. Her behaviour was so rude and I politely told her so, whereupon she shouted “I’m not being rude. If you listened the first time there wouldn’t be a problem!” A second attendant then shouted at several of us for standing too close to the gate by the scanner. My sons and I were shocked by the aggressive and rude way we were treated, and other passengers expressed similar feelings. How on earth would people with learning difficulties or other frailties cope with this treatment?! Upsetting end to our holiday in the USA - made us glad to be getting back on a plane to the UK! Training is urgently needed to remind these people that travellers are human beings with feelings, who are paying a lot of money for their flights and who deserve to be treated with basic respect! After security we paid a lot of money for food that arrived cold and after a very long wait. Overall not a positive experience."
Netherlands,Oct-19,"On several locations I really felt treated like cattle. “Move up, stand there, don’t go there’s, etc.. Come on staff, treat us the way you want to be treated yourself."
UK,Oct-19,Went through immigration and customs in 30 minutes. I’ve read a great many reviews about slow long lines at immigration but we arrived on time from UK and were through in a very short time.
UK,Oct-19,"Rude, unhelpful and officious staff; do they receive special training to unlearn basic customer service? My mother taught me to smile and say “please” and “thankyou”. Incompetent and inefficient setup; have they never seen how other international airports work? Please someone, go visit Changi or Haneda to see how to do it properly. On arrival, there was just one immigration officer for two full planes. Long lines of unhappy people ordered around like cattle. I’ve previously missed connecting flights due to extremely long wait times in immigration. On departure, surly staff are needlessly rude. Security is a joke with little understanding of the concept of flow. Terminal 7 is small with very basic amenities. I’ve travelled internationally every month for the last 25-years, and in my experience, JFK is one of the worst airports in the world. If first and last impressions matter, then JFK is a total fail and does NYC a massive disservice. Avoid if at all possible."
US,Oct-19,"I arrived home to find that my checked bag had been opened, it was locked when I checked it and not locked when I got to my destination. I know that TSA will randomly open and check a bag which I have no problem with, however, I had 2 carefully packaged whiskey glasses from Hudson Valley Distillers which were missing. It is a shame when those who have the job of security cannot be trusted. The glasses were of very little value monetarily but a reminder of an otherwise wonderful trip. I was told a long time ago that you are only worth what you are willing to lie or steal for, in this case about $5, oh worthy individuals. Maybe TSA should make those who open a bag register and do so under camera surveillance. Who's the real security threat? Oct 19 Jetblue flight 161 from JFK to Sacramento in case anyone cares"
UK,Oct-19,"This was the worst arrivals experience I have ever had. I have visited many airports, including some in developing African countries and JFK stands out from all of them. Standing in a queue for 2 hours (with 2 children) just to get through immigration is totally unacceptable. I thought maybe there were some staff on strike or something, but no, there just weren't enough staff - only about half of the counters were open. Why? When we finally got through our baggage was on the floor next to the carousel - it had had to be taken off so that the carousel could be used for another flight! None of the staff I asked could tell me why the queue was so long (when we were at the back and couldn't see what was going on). One lady, when I said ""excuse me, can you tell me what's going on?"" Just said ""No"" and carried on walking! Absolutely dreadful after an eight hour flight. My daughter went to the toilet after we finally retrieved our baggage and said they were disgusting. And when we got I to a taxi and told the driver where we needed to go, which was an airport hotel, he asked ""where is that?"" and I had to give him the full address! I hadn't realised London was such a paradise. I hope never to fly in to this airport again."
France,Oct-19,"This is the worst experience I have had in an airport. 3 hours was not enough to get through immigration and transfer to the connecting flight. The airlines say that they were on time so, it’s not their fault. Nobody will pay for a hotel until we can get on another flight to our final destination. All the staff in the airport were unhelpful, even the supervisor who advised us to come back to her after 30 minutes if we had not gotten to the security checkpoint. She just said we had to kept waiting, and, as a result, we missed our transfer. I used to like the USA. I now have no intention of coming back or spending any money on American products."
UK,Oct-19,1hr 30mins to clear passport control even with the automated system. Without doubt the worst arrivals experience I have had. Totally unacceptable that there were only 2 border control officers for the whole of international arrivals.
US,Oct-19,"I was extremely disappointed in the customer service at JFK airport. I had numerous encounters where staff/individuals were unwilling to assist with questions, I was told different agents to see, multiple numbers to call, I was told to not step up to a counter without being “told” by agent and then told to step up and fill in gaps when there were gaps in TSA lines - I assimilated this experience with being a cattle in a barnyard - quite inhuman. The experience was terrible and I will go to great lengths to not fly through the airport in the future. Lastly the personnel gives your city and our nation a bad image for visitors and I hope you think about how to train staff in a more effective manner."
US,Sep-19,"Amazing, I felt like I was in some under-resourced country: old rusty bathrooms, broken escalator, insufficient seating, crowded, terrible food choices for high prices. Terminal 2 needs a complete makeover!"
US,Sep-19,"Absolutely awful. Rude, incompetent staff who were scruffy, sour faced and unhelpful and who were screaming unintelligible instructions to confused passengers of all ages. Endless snaking lines, absolute chaos. I have travelled extensively and have never, ever seen such a disgusting airport and staff. (perhaps the exception here is La Guardia Airport) How can New York put up with this being the first impression international travelers get when they arrive in the United States? A disgusting experience all in all."
UK,Aug-19,"I’m almost speechless. For an international airport this is an embarrassment. We flew from Terminal 7 and I would recommend everyone avoid if they can. Filthy, cramped, disgusting toilets, and the limited selection of hugely overpriced and underwhelming food is laughable, particularly the utterly nonsensical ordering system which involves not one trip to a cashier but 3. WiFi impossible to connect to, very limited selection of shops to pass the time in & staff rushed and rude. I thought Frankfurt airport was bad but this is on a level if not worse."
US,Aug-19,The US Customs failed to have enough staff to move people through causing my wife and our one year old son to miss their connecting flight to CLT airport. Then had to wait longer do to Delta airlines aircraft problem.
UK,Aug-19,"Terminal 4 is appalling. We arrived from Manchester and queued 1 and a half hours to get through immigration. After a 7 hour flight this really is not ideal. I witnessed one lady member of staff whilst directing people as to which queue they should go in, talking to and pulling facial expressions which were totally unacceptable. When we departed to go back to the UK I was absolutely appalled at the rudeness of one member of staff. We were taken 2 floors down to an alternative security area (due to the security area in departures being too busy). The organisation was ridiculous. One lady spoke to my 2 teenage sons in a totally disrespectful and rude manner. Totally uncalled for. She spoke to them like they were stupid - they are far from stupid. I am annoyed with myself for not saying anything at the time, however, I was stunned and also in the position of possibly affecting our ability to board the flight had I confronted her. The staff in this airport are rude."
Netherlands,Aug-19,"One of the worst airports ever. Staff are extremely unfriendly and the queues last forever. They are so inefficiënt. Airport taxes are high, and for what? Food courts are far too expensive. I hated the experience."
US,Aug-19,Food prices are a complete and utter disgrace. Water over $4. One banana costs $1.99. Terminal size is poky. No decent shopping. Will never return via this airport - amazed at such poor facilities servicing one of the busiest cities in the world. Once again food prices are a disgrace.
Philippines,Jul-19," I arrived at JFK from Manila on a Philippine Airlines flight in May 2019, used it for both arrival and departure on JetBlue in June 2019, and then used it for transit from a JetBlue flight to a Philippine Airlines flight in July 2019. Sure, you can get to this airport from seemingly anywhere around the world, and it services the exciting city of New York. The TSA agents typically are surprisingly decent too. And check-in staff are usually pretty nice. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the extent of the positives about this airport. Upon arrival in Terminal 1, I was greeted by a customs and immigration facility that appeared to be under construction. It looked awful - all torn up! A passport control officer was basically just waving all of us in the U.S. Citizens line through while wishing us a good one. It seemed to take a really long time for luggage to arrive on the carousel. I don't mean my luggage personally. I mean anyone's luggage! Meanwhile, staff informed my parents (who were picking me up there) that everyone from our flight had already exited customs - when none of us had yet! My first flight into JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight out of JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight back to JFK on JetBlue was delayed. I think the only reason my flight back to Manila on Philippine Airlines was NOT delayed was that it took off at 3:45 A.M., when no one else was flying out of the airport! Transiting from terminal to terminal is a hassle, too. It requires exiting your first terminal, walking down a seemingly endless hallway to the AirTrain, taking the AirTrain to your second terminal's stop, and then walking down another seemingly endless hallway to that terminal proper. Then, of course, because you're coming in from outside the secure area, you have to go through security all over again! As for food and beverage outlets, most appear to range from relatively expensive to borderline price gouging. One very notable exception was the Dunkin' Donuts landside in Terminal 1. It appears to be the only dining option available 24 hours, and so it was the only place I could use my $20 meal voucher landside, since my flight departed in the middle of the night. At Dunkin' Donuts, I was informed that if I was going to use my meal voucher, then I had to spend at least $20. I was astonished! I struggled to manage to buy $20 worth of food and drink there. I made myself sick. I still do not understand why they would not accept the voucher for a smaller amount. It's not like they would be losing money on the deal! Add to all of this restrooms which are often not very clean and with sensors which automatically turn on sink faucets when you're nowhere near them (but don't turn on when you are near them). Finally, there's the issue of the airport's being quite far from Manhattan. I've heard LaGuardia and Newark are even worse. If so, then heaven help the people who fly out of there!"
UK,Jul-19,God help you clearing security here. 30mins wait for a bag that gets checked. One member of staff checking each. One supervisor watching for a while. Several staff members floating around.
UK,Jul-19,"Have never met staff as rude as they are at this airport! Arrived from London and was told by airline staff to go in the quick connect queue for our connecting flight to Orlando. A member of staff came over screaming at us that we were in the wrong queue, when I asked where we were supposed to go she just shouted “read the signs”. We ended up in a queue behind at least 50 people with one desk open. When it got to 15 minutes before our gate was due to close I asked several members of staff for assistance only to be ignored and told to wait. I managed to persuade fellow passengers to let me and my group go to the front of the queue. We then had to collect our luggage and go back through departures and security to get our connecting flight. When we got to the gate it had been changed last minute and was in a different terminal. Running around the terminal trying to find a screen with the correct information was like a scene from Hone Alone!!! We then had to get a bus over to the new gate. I fully expected to have missed the flight however we were lucky in that the flight had arrived late. We got to the gate just as it was closing. Thankfully just in time. This airport is totally disorganised and probably the worst airport experience I’ve had. I wouldn’t fly here again."
Canada,Jul-19,"In November of 2018 I went to Iceland, Norway and Alaska, with an overnight layover at JFK before boarding a connection to Seattle. This airport is absolutely disgusting, however, I must admit that customs and TSA were good, and I actually found them polite. However, as for the rest of the airport, Delta is horribly rude, the restaurants are disgusting and the baggage carts are a total rip off, a scam, charging $6.00 for the use of them, and on top of that they scream at you, in Toronto there is no charge. Then I get to Seattle and Alaska and people are polite and helpful. Going through JFK you feel as if you're going through another dimension."
UK,Jul-19,"As others have said, this is a third world airport. Avoid at all costs. The reason for this is the rudeness and total ineptness of staff you come across. It seems that to wear a uniform at JFK airport turns that person in to someone who thinks they are head of the Military or Police. Let me tell you something, you can still be nice to people. YOU have to travel sometimes, does the experience of coming across someone with your attitude make you happy? Of course it doesn't. On Monday evening, all us travellers waiting to have our bags scanned were herded in to an area and made to wait. Huge unnecessary queues. How many x-ray scanners were available? Two. And they would let 4 or 5 people through at a time to the underworked customs staff. And not a smile anywhere. Thankfully I had Priority boarding which meant I could get through relatively quickly (about half an hour). I didn't bother with the priority boarding at the actual gate as the staff were clearly uninterested in this. If I ever have the misfortune of going through JFK again, I will make sure to be there at least 4 hours before the plane leaves. Coming through was relatively easy thanks to the ESTA process but getting shouted at by certain staff was amusing. Again, something to tell you: we love coming to visit but have no intention of wanting to stay in your lovely country illegally. Really, I like where I live. So, Florida next year. I am assuming they are still happy staff down there because, well, it's Florida. JFK staff could learn a lot from other countries where people love their jobs.The UK, Spain, France, Netherlands, Czech, Germany, South America, Australia, the list is endless."
US,Jul-19,I am appalled. I live here. We spent 40 minutes waiting for the airplane door to open and then an hour going through security (still waiting). It is very hot. I travel a lot and I’m always sad coming back through us airports compared to other airports I have been.
UK,Jul-19,"We arrived on Virgin 0153 at 4pm on Thursday 27th June. We passed through Passport Control at 7.22 pm. The heat was horrendous. Little children, babies and elderly people were all standing for hours in horrendous heat. Around half the booths were unmanned. There were few staff to help and signage showed that this was a regular occurrence. The whole place was scruffy, chaotic and a truly shameful introduction to a great nation. All Americans should be outraged that the management of this atrocious facility are providing a shockingly bad first impression of their nation. I have travelled extensively throughout Europe, Asia and Africa and can truly say this was my worst ever introduction to a country that really couldn't care less about the impression it gives to visitors."
US,Jun-19,"Arrived after a Delta international flight. It was 3 pm on a Monday and it looked like every international flight had just landed. Utterly packed at customs with countless snaking, endless lines. No rhyme or reason what kiosk you went to. No order to the queuing. Airport staff just awful, not directing. Waited in line for 1.5 hrs. Then after finally getting through this horror, no directions to connecting flights, hardly any tv screens for departure gate times, they don’t tell you the terminal attached to the gate, so we wound up walking to gate B51, which was endless from customs. Totally antiquated, third world calibre airport. Shocking to see this in NYC. It needs to be demolished and rebuilt from scratch. Barely any seats at crowded terminals gate, hardly any eateries, awful."
Netherlands,Jun-19,"Why is everybody so unfriendly and rude? Are employees selected on that quality? The quality to boss people around, no smiling and not responding to questions. I really don’t understand!"
US,Jun-19,"Today, I had a very unpleasant experience at JFK Terminal 5 with TSA JetBlue. There is an older TSA who was standing there flexing the line. I informed him that I have 10 minutes before my plane leaves, is there any way to get assistance. I informed him that my family was actually all the way in the front and that I was behind because I had issues with my luggage. I repeated myself several times and he just kept on looking at me and shooing me away. This is extremely unprofessional as I am a manager myself. This is not the type of customer service they should be providing even though he is a TSA member. When I arrived to the check point, I informed another member that wasn’t part of TSA, she had gave me the same inappropriate manner. She said “I can’t do anything, stay in line”. This is the worst service ever. I hope senior managers can coach their employees here at this airport. This can ruin an individuals experience."
UK,Jun-19," Immigration was terrible here, no clear queing for automatic machines just a free for all. The camera would not capture my wife's picture she was too short, then it rejected my fingerprints and we ended up in the manual queue. This all took an hour and a half and our bags had been dumped off the carousel by the time we arrived. On our return to come home we had arrived in one part of T4 and had to take a bus to the other part but did not have to redo security, the gates at T4 were crowded and not terribly clean."
US,Jun-19," This is a horrible airport! I will never use this airport again if I can help it. It has a stupid, hard to figure out layout. I had to walk through the rain to change terminals. The gate areas were small and confusing as well. Then when I returned through customs and had some duty-free merchandise I was treated very rudely by a tsa worker in security and had some of my merchandise confiscated even though it was duty free and not brought from outside the airport! This is ridiculous and the worker was a complete jerk about the situation. I consider myself an understanding and patient person but this airport tested both!"
Norway,May-19,Insane! I’d never expected New York to have a 3rd world class airport. This is the worst airport I’ve ever been at and I’ve been to a few. I will never return to this airport!
US,May-19,"Worst airport experience, thankfully I have not had any other bad airport experiences. Upon arrival from the UK my family and I had to go through customs. I do not attribute the experience at customs with JFK but it was pretty bad as well. The customs officer was extremely rude and acted put off by being there. Once I got to security I realized we were precheck, yay for us right? I was told that we didn't need to take our shoes off by the officer checking our passes. Then we were yelled at by the lady at the scanning belt that we had to take out shoes off, then she yelled at us for putting our carry on bags in the bins (I don't want my bags on the dirty belts), she continued to roll her eyes while yelling at us. Worst experience, very unprofessional, hope to never have to fly through JFK again!"
US,May-19,So poorly managed and under staffed. The staff that was on which was only two people were so unhappy. We thousands of people waiting. If you could go anywhere else I would trust me!
UK,Apr-19,"Awful, worst airport I’ve ever been in. Security was totally unorganised, duty free and waiting area a mess and everything grossly overpriced. USA sending you home with good memories or experience! The home of customer service is majorly let down by this airport (terminal 7)."
US,Apr-19,"What an absolute embarrassment for an American airport. This is the first and sometimes only American operation thousands of international travelers see every day, and y'all should not be proud. I need to use the restroom, there is urine on literally every toilet seat, can't imagine the last time this place was cleaned. The plug is so old and used it can't hold my laptop plug in place, I'm having to keep my leg against it right now to keep my laptop charging. The wifi I kid you not is not allowing me to stream Pandora, a music service. This is 2019 folks, come on this is a first rate embarrassment for an American airport."
UK,Apr-19,Arrived from Manchester UK at 1.10pm. I was hoping it had improved since my last visit 4 years ago but I am afraid it was a shambles. The new esta system supported by self inputting machines make things worse and even then you still have to go through an interview with immigration. The hall was overwhelmed with people and staff who are very stressed and rude. I’ve been to four other American airports from the uk and this one exists from the dark ages. America you are letting yourself down. It’s a disgrace. We will not come back and I heard numerous other travellers saying the same thing.
US,Apr-19, JFK is a third world airport. The lines through immigration are awful. The connecting flight process is terrible. There could’ve no worse introduction to people entering the USA. Dismal and pathetic for this to represent our country.
UK,Apr-19," On arriving at JFK after a seven hour flight from Manchester I experienced what I can only describe as the most disorganised, inefficient, unwelcoming and stressful arrival into another country I have ever had. Total confusion and lack of clarity with no clear signage placed in the right positions is responsible in my opinion. The staff are abrasive and constantly shouting unclear instructions at the top of their voices. Long queues make for a very long wait together with the niggling doubt that you may be in the wrong queue because there is no clear signage or instruction. This was my first visit to New York, although not to the US, and my first impression of this city is one of very unwelcoming and rude customs staff. I have not experienced this at any of the other US airports I have arrived at. Surely someone needs to sort this out - perhaps management needs an overhaul. It seems ironic that the US prides itself on its customer service so what’s gone wrong here?"
US,Apr-19,"JFK confirmed again today why it is my least favorite and most avoided airport. If it weren’t for the competitive international fares I’m able to acquire due to routing through this airport, I’d never come. My plane landed at 4:30a, closing out an all-night flight of 11-1/2 hours. We were first to Passport Control, but other flights also arrived and discharged their passengers. There were hundreds in line, and only one agent was checking in the sea of American citizens returning home. Airport staff barked directions at incoming passengers, but with no clarity or organization or apparent purpose, generating even more confusion and frustration. My husband and I were near the front of the line; still, it was an hour before our passports were cleared. Exiting Control we followed signs for Connecting Flights. The main Connecting lobby was closed, so someone shouted from the top of the escalator to come upstairs. Once there we had the “pleasure” of joining all the Departing Passengers - both those Connecting (like us) and those just starting their trips. We stood in long Security lines, were yelled at by TSA staff or rudely ignored, and ultimately had three of our five parcels inspected/rifled. The airline staff has been courteous and helpful and genuinely concerned with passenger comfort and safety. The JFK airport staff, however, is the complete antithesis. How embarrassing for all of us, knowing that millions receive this sorry treatment. Get your act together, NY. Future passengers, be warned. Maybe your experience will be a good one. Or maybe you, too will take away the degrading experience that was mine today. By the way, airport staff are warm and friendly with each other, even as the passengers they serve are wearily (and angrily) working their way through JFK’s cattle call process."
UK,Apr-19,Travelling from the UK to New York myself and my wife landed about 4 pm on a Tuesday. We had to suffer over 2 hours of queuing in passport control which is totally unacceptable. We were penned in “cattle lines” for the duration. A total lack of staff and information. On exiting to the luggage carousel we couldn’t see a carousel with our flight on it. After walking about with no help or advice from staff we found our luggage lying in a pile in the corner. Things improved on the return as there was adequate staff. I will not use JFK again!
Denmark,Mar-19,"JFK, terminal 1 - don’t go there if you are hungry, food is terrible even for airport standards. I have been through many airports in my life. Staying in terminal 1 in JFK is one of the worst experiences for a long time. Had “dinner” at The Local - The food was worth a -2 star (minus 2) - had one bite of a burger and left the rest of the really overpriced food. I have never tasted something so bad and non prepared, not even ketchup could save this. Looking at the other restaurants and the ratings I can only imagine how bad they are as well. Not a single one have more than 3 stars and most are closer to 2 stars. JFK, JFK - what are you thinking having these bad restaurants? Is it on purpose, you would like a perfect vacation ending badly? It really feels like you do not care at all. The customer potential is huge, so why having all these non quality “restaurants”? To be honest I am amazed that “The Local” even have a license to serve food. For sure I will not put a cent in this terminal in the future. JFK, wake up now."
UK,Mar-19," Horrendous experience. I’m actually writing this as I’m stood in queue to get through passport control. So far it’s been a 1.5 hr wait with what I estimate to be another half hour at least till we actually get to the front of the queue. There is only 2 desks on (1 disabled and 1 able bodied) despite there being over 60 kiosks within the floor. We have a connecting flight to Las Vegas which I doubt we will actually make and there have been no apologies from staff in the slightest. There are no clear signs anywhere except throne at the start of the long snaking queue to say it would take 35 mins (which means that it’s now out by over an hour). Not a staff member in sight. Horrendous customer service with no professionalism. I can’t see any toilets and I am so thirsty it’s ridiculous. No refreshments. As I take over 33 pills a day for my illnesses I often need a drink as I get a dry mouth. No common courtesy given to anyone visiting this supposedly customer service friendly country. This isn’t at all about safety, this is purely down to an incompetent management. My advice - sack them all and start again! Terrible start to the holiday, was planning on visiting NYC with my daughter this coming February but definitely rethinking this after our experience today. Never known anything like it! I’ve attached photos of the queue (now 1hr 50 mins in) and the empty booths so you can see how inept staff are at making sure customers are dealt with swiftly and securely. This review wouldn’t allow me to leave a zero score as it’s needed a minimum of 1 star however if up to me then it would be a minus score. Take my advice fly into any other airport other than this one!"
UK,Mar-19,"The most awful airport I have travelled through in my life - and I have travelled a fair amount. The security check was very long, we had to wait about 30+ mins to get through and the queue wasn’t even that long. They had stopped and searched a woman and because they didn’t have any other woman officers, none of us women waiting could go through until they found what was setting off the alarm on her, again adding to the wait. The conveyer belt is the shortest I have seen which means all the baggage piles up until you are through the security check. Their website is wrong and they have very limited, over priced food options available which are limited to burgers or burgers or have I mentioned burgers! As a vegetarian and health conscious person this really has set me off on the wrong foot for our journey home. The shopping options again, are very limited and quite frankly equals to or even worse than a local small airport. I’ve heard BA had “invested” in the airport to make it better. I fear to think how it must have been before."
UK,Mar-19," Honestly I would rarely review an airport but I was shocked at how truly awful this airport is. It’s a long haul travellers nightmare. This service would simply not run in the UK- it makes our busiest airports in London look timid by comparison. First off if you’re catching a connecting flight through here good luck, the airport is huge and it is not clear where you’re supposed to be going. Not great when this is your first time here. I was stood in a customs queue that wound on forever until I got panicky my connecting flight was in 40 mins. I stepped out to inform them and they told me to ‘go over there’. I wander over to a desk and a rude lady asks what I’m doing and I need to scan my passport first - well sorry the man did not tell me that! Wouldn’t it be helpful to tell me? They start whispering in another language and exchanging looks as if this isn’t an airport where new people enter every single day. I’m not thick thanks. Then comes the icing on the cake - the ever so fun customs lady who dragged her feet over to man 1 of 2 customs desks. She tells me she needs to sit down first and takes as long as possible with an attitude. Sorry I know the job is stressful but suck it up lady. Then she starts getting really intimidating telling me I’m not stood near the camera enough and I’m telling her sorry I’m flustered as I need to catch my flight. She seems totally unsympathetic and continues being rude. Sorry but I just got off a 7 hour flight from Manchester and I had 30 mins to get through security and to the gate - excuse me if I’m a little disoriented by your awful airport! She then makes me scan both my hands at least 11 times and it was very clear she was doing it to toy with me. I mean seriously who employs these people. Luckily I kept it together to avoid trouble but I have never met such rude airport staff in my life! I’m so glad I wasn’t travelling to NYC because boy what a welcome to that city. I know New Yorkers are known for being brash but they were just simply obnoxious and unprofessional. Boy was I glad to get to LAX in sunny California where the staff were lovely and helpful. I’ve never been particularly interested in NYC and it’s -10 weather as it seems like a more aggressive version of London and this airport just confirms my opinion on the place."
UK,Mar-19,"Our flight landed slightly early around 11am, we got to the immigration hall and stood in a queue which didn't appear to be too bad, however, we then realised that only 2 out of all of the booths were actually manned. Every so often one of the people manning the booth would walk away for about 5 minutes leaving just one booth open. It was taking an average of between 3 and 5 minutes per person going through immigration. There were other staff members wandering around but nobody seemed to take charge. It took us around 2 hours to get through this fiasco but by this time the queue was about 4 times bigger than when we arrived and one of the booths was about to close because the lady was going for lunch. I dread to think how long it took those poor people to get through. I was absolutely amazed that in a country renowned for its customer service, this was allowed to happen - where were the management, or at least somebody to take charge and get additional staff in."
Germany,Mar-19,"Arriving with EVA air from Taipei the flight was on time but JFK authorities did not have a parking spot available for approx 1 hour. A nightmare after a 16 hour flight! Once out of the plane immigration procedures were next. A huge and extensive hall with plenty of booths but only one was open. One officer for 4 wide body aircrafts. Where are all the officers? Sleeping, chatting, taking a break? Welcome to the service desert called USA. Any questions raised are replied like you are a criminal, rude and agressive. Overall that gives any arriving visitor a good impression of what to expect within this snobbish and rude country. Try to avoid whenever possible. B.t.w., lack of immigration officers is common. At another time I experienced that 2 out of 53 counters were open."
Belgium,Mar-19,The worst airport I have ever been to (and I travel a lot!). We were 4 hours early for a flight and just made it on time because of the very long queue both for check in and through security. Staff were extremely rude! In fact I saw a member of the public ask a member of staff if she worked for the airport as she needed help and the staff member simply said 'no' even though she was wearing a uniform and clearly on duty. She just couldn't be bothered to help! Unnecessarily stressful and the worst organization I have ever seen.
Norway,Mar-19,"The annocments for passengers and changed flights happen all the time, it was loud, annoying and the girl on the microphone ruined the waiting. Fix the mic, speakers and please stop with announcements. Also very expensive."
US,Feb-19," Arrived from Seoul to JFK Terminal 4. Connecting flight to Boston scheduled to depart from Terminal 2. Waiting for 2 hours at Terminal 2, you cannot even get a wifi connection, the free JFK wifi signal is not strong enough to connect to the web. After 4 (!!) gate changes, back on the shuttle bus to Terminal 4! Add to this a $13 sandwiches, this is a horror show, not an airport. I thought Manila, Philippines, airport was slow and inefficient, but at least they don't jerk you around the airport from gate to gate, and you get better wifi in Manila than at JFK,"
UK,Feb-19,Absolutely shocking airport on both the times we were here. Very long queuing times. Staff are so rude and very unhelpful. Although we loved New York this airport has put us off ever coming back. We are frequent travellers so we are aware of how busy an airport can get. We were left infuriated still when we boarded our flight back to the UK.
Denmark,Feb-19,"JFK is by far the worst airport I've been to. Why don't they have a stroller or something, for family's with small children? No smoking area (its my review, so I write whats important tp me!) once through security, you are stuck at the same 20 something gates, and a handfull of bad cafe's! Very bad airport! Wifi is slow as though from the 1990!"
UK,Feb-19," I was disgusted by the treatment of security staff and how they spoke to people and shouted at them. On arrival the staff were hostile (mainly the women) and in departure I overheard one security woman telling her colleague that people are “scared of her” to which she found this to be very amusing, another shouted orders in the face of an old woman telling her to pick up her tray off the floor, she was very intimidating and would have been better suited to working in a prison than in an airport. I was disgusted at this and how these people are a representation of your country, something needs to be done about the way they approach and interact with passengers. Most of the security were stood around in large groups talking and one women was whining about how she hated being theirs and wanted to go home. It was a horrible experience."
US,Jan-19,"On Delta Airlines I flew out of Terminal 2 and returned through Terminal 4 for a domestic trip. The terminals differ enormously by size- Terminal 2 is very much smaller and very compact. Terminal 4 is huge with many stores and eateries requiring a lot of walking to and from your gate. On departure, I was surprised at the virtually non-existence security line. The gate areas have large glass panels and high ceilings. Lots of seating with electric power points. Quite a few eating places - including a Wendy’s - for a terminal with less than a dozen gates. My first time in Terminal 2 and highly recommend it. Delta had staff at the terminal entrance to assist you. Terminal 4 was very busy and required a long walk out from my gate. Just outside Terminal 4 is dedicated space for Uber and such service cars to come to pick up clients - this is very convenient. In short, my experience was quite positive and was very pleased with Terminal 2 especially."
US,Jan-19,Just warning everyone not to be stupid like I was. i went to the taxi line and a man in a black suit with a tie said “taxi?” I said yes. He said “the taxi is waiting for you.” It was a black SUV. I told him “this is not a taxi “. He replied that it was an UBER and it was cheaper than a taxi. I have taken taxis before and it was around $60. This driver told me I had to pay $8.50 in tolls. Talked the entire time telling me how hard he works and only makes $10 an hour. Takes me to my destination and asks for cash and charges me $160 for the ride and then asked for a tip. My fault for being stupid!! Take a yellow cab!
US,Jan-19,"This was one of the most unorganized airports I’ve been in. I arrived way early and spent the entire time standing in lines. I was ultimately herded to a line for babies and handicap which merged with another line, when babies and handicap should have been in one separate line. I will never fly out of this airport again. Also, it is too far from Manhattan."
